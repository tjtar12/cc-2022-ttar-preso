###### Opportunities ######
- Working primarily on the FanDuel project has allowed me to see the true value of the 'DevOps' movement.  Our growth as a team will be heavily tied to the our ability to provide 'DevOps' value to our client base

###### Challenges ######
- Balancing the needs of the giant needy whale (FanDuel) with other opportunities.
- Finding the next 'FanDuel'

## Reflections and Future ##

![bg left:50% fit](./images/time.png)

- Too much time spent on one account.
- FanDuel's revenue will drop and so will my time towards it.
- 2022 and beyond must be about net new accounts.
- 2022 will be about growing the next set of Solution Specialists to grow the business
